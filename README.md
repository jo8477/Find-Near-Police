# Find-Near-Police

This Python file is a program that finds the closest security center to the address of the property the user is looking at on a real estate site (ex. 다방).

original csv data link : https://www.data.go.kr/data/15112633/fileData.do?recommendDataYn=Y

Modify the csv file to add latitude and longitude data
Modified csv file name : changeANSI.csv

Note 
- Delete about 500 data that could not be converted to latitude and longitude among about 2500 data
- The chrome driver needs to be downloaded and replaced with the driver in the es folder by downloading the version suitable for the chrome version you are using.

Future work
- Developing a Chrome extension program that functions the same as this program.
